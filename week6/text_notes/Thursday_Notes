Git workflow with two people:

- One person creates repository
- add friend as collaborator
  - person 1 does normal workflow
  - person 2 git clone repo, gets copy of repository
  - person 2 git pushes to repository
  - person 1 git pulls

all a merge conflict is is more than one person editing the same part of a file

NEVER PULL IF YOU HAVE UNCOMMITTED WORK

Try and only push working changge
